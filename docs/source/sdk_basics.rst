SDK Basics
============

If you do not yet have experience using Open OnDemand to launch Jupyter Notebooks, please first review the documentation :ref:`High Performance Compute Portal`. Be sure to follow all instructions, including :ref:`Setting Up Conda Environments`

Flywheel's Software developer's kit "SDK" is a set of pre-written functions and documentation allowing users to easily interact with the Flywheel database from python matlab. Check out Flywheel's useful examples to get started `here <https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/product/backend/sdk/tags/20.0.0/python/getting_started.html>`_ .

If you are interested in using the Flywheel Python SDK you need to first set up a conda environment and install the flywheel python package OR access an already built environment on RC nodes using `incenv` or `flywheel` conda environments.

Follow our example tutorial using the Flywheel SDK to :ref:`Flyhweel Software Developer Kit (SDK) Basics and Helpful Hints`.
