Flywheel Documentation Resources
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* `Main Flywheel Documentation Page <https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us>`_
    * Good starting place for high level overview
* `Flywheel Webinars <https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360044852353>`_
    * Webinars that Flywheel has hosted on various topics
* `Flywheel Gear Exchange <https://flywheel.io/gear-exchange/>`_
    * Different analysis gears that have been developed by the Flywheel team that can be installed on our INC instance
* `Flywheel Python SDK ReadTheDocs Full Documentation <https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/product/backend/sdk/branches/master/python/index.html>`_
    * Documentation on the Python Software Development Kit (SDK) that enables the user to write Python code that can be interpreted by Flywheel
* `Flywheel Python SDK Quickstart <https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/product/backend/sdk/branches/master/python/quick_reference.html>`_
    * The Quickstart is all the useful SDK commands in one place
* `Flywheel CLI Documentation <https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360008162214-Installing-the-Flywheel-Command-Line-Interface-CLI->`_
    * A guide to using the Flywheel Command Line Interface (CLI) tool for everything from data ingestion to running gears
* `Flywheel CLI Beta Version Documentation <https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/tools/app/cli/fw-beta/gear/>`_
    * A beta (second) version of the CLI that included additional userful tools

Flywheel Code Resources
+++++++++++++++++++++++
* `GitLab of Flywheel Tutorials <https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/public/flywheel-tutorials>`_
    * Code (mostly Jupyter Notebook) tutorials covering CLI, Python, and different code Webinars for the Flywheel SDK
* `GitLab of Flywheel Gears <https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/flywheel-apps>`_
    * The code behind the Flywheel gears. This code can be downloaded, modified, and rebuilt for the purpose of customizing gears
* `GitHub of Flywheel Gears <https://github.com/flywheel-apps>`_
    * Some Flywheel gears are still stored on GitHub versus GitLab
* `Templates for building out Flywheel Gears <https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/flywheel-apps/templates>`_
    * Particularly useful is the bids-app-template if creating gears from scratch
* `Docker Hub for Flywheel Images <https://hub.docker.com/u/flywheel>`_
    * All Flywheel gears run as either docker or singularity containers. This dockerhub allows you to see (and download) the docker images for those gears directly (without having to build them locally).

INC Flywheel-related Resources
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* `INC Github <https://github.com/intermountainneuroimaging>`_
    * The INC Github page contains INC-modified Flywheel Gears as well as other singularity containers and analysis code that INC staff have built
